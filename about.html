                <h3>How They're Made</h3>
                <p class="emphasis">How does ReMitts turn old sweaters, destined for the landfill, into new mittens?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wool sweaters are donated by Madison-area thrift stores and ReMitts’ supporters.</li>
                    <li>Volunteers launder the sweaters in hot water and dry them in hot dryers, causing the sweaters to shrink or “felt.”</li>
                    <li>Pattern pieces are cut from the felted wool, combining complementary colors and designs.</li>
                    <li>The pieces are machine sewn into mittens into women’s, men’s and children’s sizes.</li>
                    <li>Each pair is lined with cozy fleece.</li>
                    <li>Women’s and children’s mittens are embellished with buttons, which are also donated.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How They Began</h3>
                <p>ReMitts started when Janet Tupy admired “upcycled” mittens – mittens made from old sweaters – at a gift shop.
                “I remembered reading about a pastor in a small church who gave each member of the congregation $100 with the charge to ‘grow’ the money and donate the proceeds,” said Janet. “I thought, ‘What could I do with $100 dollars of seed money? How much could I grow for a good cause?’”
                When she saw the upcycled mittens, she knew immediately what she could do with $100. Even though she hadn’t sewn in many years, she thought, “I could do this!”  She gathered a few friends, they found a pattern, bought some wool sweaters at a thrift store, and made their first mittens. The year was 2009, and their goal was to raise $1,000 to donate to local food pantries. They raised $4,000.
                Fast forward to 2016, when the small group of friends, which grew to approximately two dozen friends, raised more than $50,000. Altogether, ReMitts has raised more than $225,000 for local food pantries.
                By taking something that was destined for the landfill and repurposing it, ReMitts and the customers who buy the mittens are feeding hungry people.</p>
